# About Me

## Bio

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sophie, a senior computer science student with a passion for bioinformatics. I'm enthusiastic about combining computational techniques with wet lab experiments to unravel the mysteries of life sciences. ðŸ§¬ðŸ”¬

## Education

- **Current:** Senior Computer Science Student in the Early Entry program for Bioinformatics (Schrodinger's Grad Student)
- **University:** University of North Carolina at Charlotte
- **Concentration:** Bioinformatics

## Interests

- Genomic Analysis ðŸ§¬
- Front End Design and Accessibility ðŸ¤–
- Computational Biology Algorithms ðŸ§®
- Data Visualization for Biological Insights ðŸ“Š

## Skills

- **Programming Languages:** Python, Java, R/RMarkdown, BASH
- **Bioinformatics Tools:** Seaview, MrBayes
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub
- **R Packages:** MSA, Phangorn, Phytools

## Projects

- [DeGenPrime](https://github.com/raw-lab/DeGenPrime): DeGenPrime is a primer design tool compatible with single gene and gene family alignments that unlocks the tree of life like never before. I work on the front end of the program (still currently in development), with a focus on maintaining a eye-pleasing color scheme that is accessible to those with colorblindness or other visual impairments. I understand how scary the command line can be to those that don't have experience with it, so I am working with my PI to create GUIs for our tools, furthering the reach of these computational resources. [The DeGenPrime preprint can be accessed at this link.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.11.553048v1)
